Sequence Alignment with BLAST
=============================

The goals of these problem sets are to acquaint you with sequence
databases and analysis tools and provide problems to solve so that
you become adapt at working with sequence and using the available online tools.

We have organized the course so that we provide you with a set of
problems each week that can be solved through one or several of
the online databases.

Problem 1
---------

The first problem set focuses on rather simple sequence searches.
Searching for a string of As, Gs, Ts, & Cs is made possible through
the use of an algorithm that searches for strings of nucleic acid
bases or amino acids (or simply letters). The one algorithm that
most of us use is called BLAST, which stands for Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool. Using this tool one can determine if the
sequence that you have is similar to any sequence in biological databases.
There are three possible results from a BLAST search of sequence databases.
